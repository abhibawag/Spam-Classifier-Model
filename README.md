# Spam-Classifier-Model

This is a real example of Natural Language Processing in which a machine can classify emails whether it is a Spam one or not.

In this model, I have performed the required cleaning and preprocessing on the csv file. I have used Stemming for this purpose as it is a bit faster than Lemmatization.
Then, I have created a BoW with max features = 5000 which helps in increasing accuracy a little bit as well as optimizing the time required for training the model.
And Then I have trained the model with 20% test data.

Accuracy of the model coming out to be 98.48%
